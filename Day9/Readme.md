# ðŸ“–For Loop in Python
## Introduction
The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code multiple times. It is one of the most commonly used loops in Python, especially for traversing collections.

##### Syntax:
    for variable in sequence:
       # Code block to execute

   - variable is a placeholder that takes the value of each element in the sequence during every iteration.
   - sequence can be any iterable (list, tuple, string, dictionary, etc.).
   - The loop continues until all elements in the sequence are exhausted.

#### 1. Example: Using range():
   The range() function is commonly used with for loops to generate a sequence of numbers:

     for i in range(5):
        print(i)

      #Output:

         0
         1
         2
         3
         4
