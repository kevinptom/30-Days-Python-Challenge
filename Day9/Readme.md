# ðŸ“–For Loop in Python
## Introduction
The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code multiple times. It is one of the most commonly used loops in Python, especially for traversing collections.

##### Syntax:
    for variable in sequence:
       # Code block to execute

   - variable is a placeholder that takes the value of each element in the sequence during every iteration.
   - sequence can be any iterable (list, tuple, string, dictionary, etc.).
   - The loop continues until all elements in the sequence are exhausted.

#### 1. Example: Using range():
   The range() function is commonly used with for loops to generate a sequence of numbers:

     for i in range(5):
        print(i)

      #Output:

         0
         1
         2
         3
         4

#### 2. Example: Iterating Over a List
        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
        for fruit in fruits:
             print(fruit)

             #Output :

             apple
             banana
             cherry

#### 3. Example: Iterating Over a String
       for char in "Python":
          print(char)

        #Output gives:

          P
          y
          t
          h
          o
          n


## ðŸ›‘Perform apython program to find first n natural numbers.


###### EXPECTED OUTPUT:
     Enter the limit:5

     The first 5 natural numbers are:

     1
     2
     3
     4
