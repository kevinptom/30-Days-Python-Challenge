Perform basic arithmetic operators in python using two input numbers.

ðŸ›‘INSTRUCTIONS:

1.Input:

â†’The input() function asks the user to enter a number.

â†’float() is used to convert the input into a floating-point number. You can use int() if you only want to work with integers.

2.Arithmetic Operations:

â†’ Addition: The + operator adds num1 and num2.

â†’ Subtraction: The - operator subtracts num2 from num1.

â†’ Multiplication: The * operator multiplies num1 and num2.

â†’ Division: The / operator divides num1 by num2. A check is made to ensure num2 is not zero to avoid a ZeroDivisionError.

â†’ Modulus: The % operator gives the remainder of dividing num1 by num2. Again, a check for division by zero is included.

â†’ Floor Division: If you want the result of division to be an integer (without decimal), you can use integer division // instead of /.




ðŸ“ŸSample Output:


Enter the first number: 12

Enter the second number: 4

The sum of 12.0 and 4.0 is 16.0

The difference when 4.0 is subtracted from 12.0 is 8.0

The product of 12.0 and 4.0 is 48.0

The quotient of 12.0 divided by 4.0 is 3.0

The remainder when 12.0 is divided by 4.0 is 0.0
